#ADDITION INTERIORS

##Create a set of apps that do the following:

The basic idea of the site is to simply give people an obvious way to
request an estimate.

Sections and heading:

  - inventory with photographs and quantity and prices?
    carpet and floors
    residential | commercial

  - specials?

  - online purchases?

  - contact us for an estimate with samples
    no deposit, no commitment, no charge

  - contact information

  - list of suppliers/manufacturers

  - gallery of high-end jobs

  - list of clients that can recommend

##Sites to emulate:
None of these sites quite hit the mark but they all have something to
offer either in layout or content.
